And generate a JSON based report to save in a Mongo DB same as this JSON, but with the information in the chat, ignore
the inner objects: "settings" and "automation_data" and other attributes in the JSON that are not included in the list 
indicated to extract the information:

If something is not found please mark it as null, but if the attribute expects a list, put it as empty list,

Here the list of attributes that expect lists:
- fitness_goal
- training_method
- lesions
- dietary_restrictions
- dietary_goals
- preferences

CONSIDERATIONS:
Make a complete report with Python format dict 
Consider that this will be automated, so if something is not right just create a template with null in all keys of the 
dict.
Include all the data available, if something is not found fill the empty spaces.
Format the json to follow good database related industry standards, make the keys equal to the example I put above. 
In your answer please limit the output to be the JSON and nothing else since this will be a automated process to save 
into database directly.
